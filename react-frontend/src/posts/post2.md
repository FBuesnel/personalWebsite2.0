# Explanation
Itâ€™s simple to explain the rest of
my life, in just these eight lines.
I met her, my perfect person.
My life is ever-expanding chasing her.

You see crystally a laugh of knowing,
only what looking into the past can provide,
in 60 years despite that being a laugh
only earned by living 60 years.
