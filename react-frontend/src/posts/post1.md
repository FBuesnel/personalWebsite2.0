# Moving Into Eternity

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akshan spent his last day in Arrowwood like he spent all his days in Arrowwood:
gardening. Acres of open plains surrounded his house, and he filled one with an eclectic
collection of plants. That’s all he ever did, really. The bus came to pick him from school
every morning at 8:30 and dropped him off back home at 4 in the afternoon. He was too
far away to play with any friends from his 5-county schools, and his ‘backyard’ was
nothing but tall, dry, dead grass. His solution was to just grow something to play in
which became the playing itself. Cedar trees, pineberry bushes, and birds of paradise
grew around a central bench he had constructed from miscellaneous planks in the fields
nearby. It looked like an insane man’s ravings put to dirt and greenery, but from the
central bench there was a mathematical order if one observed keenly enough. Engraved
into the bench with a knife was his name, “Akshan Darwish” and the date he built the
bench and started the garden. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His father raised Akshan by himself. He would also be the one to deliver Akshan
to college, two thousand miles away in New York. When he finally came into Akshan’s
bedroom asking, “Are you ready to leave?”—already an hour past when they should’ve
left—Akshan said nothing and brought his last bag to the car. Just a hundred feet from
his house, the garden was lost from view, and that was the finished book of his life
before college. He felt like a letter. Sealed, stamped, and signed with just a sending
address. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After four years, Akshan earned his degree like most people do. He graduated
with an Honors in Business from Columbia. That field was not Akshan’s favorite thing,
but he did enjoy it, well-enough at least. Mostly, his father strongly suggested it because
he had lived such a tumultuous childhood wrestling with debt, so that he desired for his
son to live a beautiful life wrestling with too much money. Perhaps that wasn’t the key to
happiness, but it was all that Akshan knew. Two important things happened to him
during this time: His father unexpectedly died, and Akshan didn’t go home. The flights
were too expensive to waste on Thanksgiving or Christmas, and during each summer he
had internships around the world. Tokyo, Dubai, London, Lahore, but none where he
could be back in Arrowtown at the garden. After his father’s death, the house became
abandoned, and Akshan felt no need to revisit a place of such pain and hardship.
At 44 years old, Akshan was wildly successful. His business that he created right
out of college was worth nine billion dollars, and he has all the money and more that his
father hoped he would have. Still, he feels unfulfilled. There is endless money, friends,
tasks to complete, and vacations, but nothing in his life gives him substance. His solace
remains in walks through Central Park, but he has forgotten what makes them matter so
much; he just knows that they do. Simultaneously his avarice unceasingly grows, so he
keeps working. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akshan eventually retires, forced out because of his age. He has a wife, a couple
kids, and lives in an arthritic-ridden body of 82. People adore him as an economical
savant; his name is prestigiously placed in the Time’s 100 Most Influential People of the
Century. Yet, he still feels unfulfilled, which is not a great emotion since he believes his
whole life has basically passed him by. On an ordinary day with one of his young
grandchildren, they ask “Where was your home? Was it anything like ours?” \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It was nothing more than a small cabin built by father’s hands…Except one
thing I can’t place my finger on.” He responds. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Did you ever go back?” \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No.” \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why not? I would have to go back at least once!” \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Akshan remembers the garden. He spends the next few hours retelling the
story with more joy than he has felt in decades. The grandchild eventually slinks away,
but Akshan just keeps going. Why did he never go back? Perhaps he was 82, perhaps his
body ached just lying in bed, and perhaps his life was “over” in most people’s traditional
sense, but he decided that he would make this journey at least once. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akshan traveled from his country estate in Syracuse, took a private plane, and
landed an hour outside of Arrowtown. Despite his family’s urging, he decided to drive
himself in his father’s only remnant, a Chrysler Newport. About half a mile from the
house, he began to cry. In the distance was a dilapidated shack—shockingly small for a
child and his father to have lived in. A bit behind was a paradoxical forest with trees that
dwarfed his old home. Akshan wept for the house, where he experiences his childhood
beauty truly cut-off becoming the past, but he wept out of joy too for his garden, no
Forest. All that remains of his father and his house are memories; the only thing that
remains of his Garden is everything and more. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he parks the car and walks behind the house, the Cedar trees look even more
majestic, and his garden disorganized but beautiful just like he planted it. This was his
legacy; this was his life. It just stood there, unknown for a few decades to him, but never
leaving. His business would eventually fail, his kids were already siphoning his fortune
into nothing, but this wondrous utopia remains. He disappears into the foliage. TheBirds of Paradise were so overgrown, the leaves so gargantuan, that he had force his way through small cracks in the vegetation. At the center remained the bench, with his name
carved into it, and a date of a man so far detached from who he is now. Yet as Akshan sat
slowly onto the bench, his little life became whole, and he felt the eternity of the world. \
